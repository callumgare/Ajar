    Deep recursion on subroutine "Win32::Console::ANSI::IO::_PrintString"

         a new line is added. -fixed.
    Thanks to Eric Zmiro for reporting this bug.
  - STDIN and STDERR are tied only if there are tty

0.07  2005/01/02
  - it's now possible to redirect STDERR or STDOUT to a file.
    Request from Phoeares Tsai.
  - added two auxiliary functions 'Title' and 'Cursor'.
  - improved the doc (limitations)

1.00  2005/07/03
  The module has been rewritten in C.
  By hooking the WriteFile API function in all the modules loaded by the
  script, it is possible to interpret the escape sequences just before they
  are written in the console.
  This suppresses several previous versions limitations:
  - no tied handles (we can duplicate STDOUT or STDERR as usual and the
    module works now with IPC::Open2 and IPC::Open3)
  - the bug with the join method is fixed. We can use threads.
  - The conversion of the Windows codepage to the console codepage (ANSI to
    OEM conversion) is done by the internal Windows functions. The
    Encode module is not used anymore (the exe made with PAR are smaller).
  - The module is smaller and faster.

1.01  2008/07/07
  Just added some auxiliary functions
  - ShowConsoleWindow: changes the console window's show state (hide, max, min...),
  - MinimizeAll: minimizes all the windows on the desktop,
  - SetCloseButton: enables/disables the close button [x] of the console window,
  - SetConsoleFullScreen: sets the console in full-screen or windowed mode (WinXP/Vista)
  - SetMonitorState: sets the monitor state (on/off/standby).

1.02  2009/02/28
  - Tests rewritten using Win32::Pipe for IPC.
  - Adding dependencies in the Makefile (thanks to Dominique Goncalves).
  - bug with Windows Vista64 + SP1 (RT#43592 and RT#43639) -fixed
    (thanks to Sisyphus)

1.03  2009/03/07 
  - Modifications of the xs so that the module can be compiled under 
    Windows x64 (with Perl 64bits). (thanks to Sisyphus)
    
1.04 2009/03/22
  - New modification of the xs: the module can now be compiled under Windows 7
    (32 and 64 bits, with Perl 32 and 64).
