I'd like to give thanks to the respective authors of these two great modules that provide the Win32 game colour and sound.

I have removed some files from these modules to reduce their size (namely the tests for Win32::Console::ANSI). If you have a rare case where you need these tests, you will need to source them from CPAN.
