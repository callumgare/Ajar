When it it is mostly secure you try to do the same with the other end. The paperclip immediately becomes hot, you hold it on with your palm until it starts to burn through your skin. You desperately hold onto the plastic end of the battery, soon watching it smoke and hiss. It bursts into flames with an explosion of metal pieces. You clench your teeth and look away, burning hot shrapnel making small holes in your clothes and body. The fire is short-lived, when you finally look back the rope around your right wrist has mostly burnt away.",
